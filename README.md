# Brainfuck Interpreter

This interpreter was written in C# and can run .bf and .b files in the console by draging it onto the executeable or just entering the path to the file.


## Usage

To use the interpreter you need to first download the executeable from the [release tab](https://git.eiflerstrom.de/IC3P3/Brainfuck-Interpreter/releases).
After that you are good to go and just need to drag a .bf or .b file onto the executeable or simple execute it and enter the path to such a file.
